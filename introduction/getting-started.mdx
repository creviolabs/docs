This guide walks you through going from zero to a published product with a shareable checkout link. The whole process takes about five minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

- An email address to create your Crevio account
- A [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) if you plan to accept paid transactions (you can start with free products and connect Stripe later)

## Set up your account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [app.crevio.co](https://app.crevio.co) and create your account. You can sign up with your email or use Google, Discord, or Telegram OAuth.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your store">
    Choose a name for your account. This is the brand name your customers will see. You will also get a free subdomain at `yourname.crevio.site` that serves as your public storefront.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete onboarding">
    Follow the onboarding steps to set your avatar, add a bio, and configure your store basics. You can always update these later from **Settings**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize your storefront

Your storefront is a link-in-bio style page where customers can browse your products. You can customize it from the **Storefront** section of your dashboard.

- **Avatar and bio** -- Add a profile image and short description.
- **Social links** -- Connect your social media profiles so customers can find you elsewhere.
- **Store blocks** -- Arrange products, text, images, videos, FAQs, and links on your page.
- **Theme** -- Customize colors and styling to match your brand.

<Tip>
  Your storefront is live at `yourname.crevio.site` as soon as you create your account. You can also [connect a custom domain](/integrations/custom-domain) later.
</Tip>

## Create your first product

Products are the core of your store. Each product has a name, description, media, and one or more price variants.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Products">
    In your dashboard, navigate to **Products** and click **New product**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add product details">
    Give your product a name and description. You can also upload cover images, add a gallery, and write rich-text content using the built-in editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a price variant">
    Every product needs at least one price variant. A price variant defines how much the product costs and how it is billed. Choose from:

    - **Free** -- No charge. Great for lead magnets or free samples.
    - **One-time payment** -- A single fixed charge (e.g., $29).
    - **Subscription** -- Recurring billing on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual cycle.
    - **Pay what you want** -- Let customers choose their own price within a range you define.

    You can add multiple price variants to a single product to offer different tiers (e.g., a monthly and annual option).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach experiences">
    Experiences are what your customers get access to after purchasing. Attach one or more experiences to each price variant:

    - Courses, digital downloads, written content, website embeds, links, forums, Discord servers, Telegram groups, or events.

    See [How Crevio works](/introduction/how-crevio-works) for a full breakdown of experience types.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    When you are ready, set the product status to **Active**. It will be published to your storefront and available for purchase.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect Stripe

To accept paid transactions, you need to connect a Stripe account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Payments** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Stripe">
    Click **Connect with Stripe** and follow the Stripe onboarding flow. If you already have a Stripe account, you can connect it directly. Otherwise, Stripe will guide you through creating one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start selling">
    Once connected, Crevio automatically creates Stripe products and prices for your price variants. Payments flow directly to your Stripe account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Free products work without Stripe. You only need to connect Stripe when you want to charge customers.
</Note>

## Share your checkout link

Every product and price variant has a shareable link you can distribute anywhere:

- **Product page** -- Share the link to your product page on your storefront (e.g., `yourname.crevio.site/products/my-course`).
- **Direct checkout link** -- Share a link that takes customers straight to checkout, skipping the product page.
- **QR code** -- Each product automatically generates a QR code you can use in print materials or presentations.

<Tip>
  Add your storefront link to your social media bios, email signatures, and content to drive traffic to your products.
