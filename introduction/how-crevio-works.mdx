Crevio is built around a simple idea: creators should be able to sell anything digital without stitching together a dozen different tools. This page explains how the platform is structured and how the pieces fit together.

## Core concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accounts">
    An **account** represents your store or brand on Crevio. Everything -- products, customers, orders, experiences -- belongs to an account.

    Each account gets a free subdomain (e.g., `yourname.crevio.site`) that serves as a public storefront. You can also connect a custom domain.

    Accounts support team collaboration. You can invite team members with admin or member roles to help manage your store.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Products">
    A **product** is what you sell. It has a name, description, media (images, videos), and one or more price variants. Products go through a lifecycle: **Draft** (work in progress), **Active** (published and available), or **Archived** (hidden from your store).

    A product must have at least one price variant and be set to Active before it can appear on your storefront.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Price variants">
    A **price variant** defines how much a product costs and how it is billed. A single product can have multiple price variants to offer different pricing tiers.

    Price variants support:
    - **Free** -- No charge
    - **Fixed one-time** -- A single payment (e.g., $49)
    - **Fixed subscription** -- Recurring billing (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual)
    - **Pay what you want** -- Customer chooses a price within a range you set

    Each price variant can also have optional settings like trial periods, limited inventory, seat-based bundles, benefits lists, and access revocation after a set number of days.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Experiences">
    An **experience** is what the customer gets access to after purchasing. Experiences are attached to price variants, so different pricing tiers can unlock different content.

    Think of it this way: the **product** is what you sell, and the **experience** is what you deliver.

    See the [full list of experience types](#experience-types) below.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customers">
    A **customer** is anyone who interacts with your store. Customers fall into three categories:
    - **Lead** -- Someone who has provided their email (e.g., through a lead magnet) but has not created an account
    - **Free** -- A registered user who has not made a paid purchase
    - **Paid** -- A registered user who has completed at least one paid order

    You can tag customers, track their order history, and manage their experience access from your dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Orders">
    An **order** is created when a customer completes a checkout. It records the payment details, the products purchased, and the experiences granted.

    Orders can have the following statuses: **Succeeded**, **Pending**, **Failed**, **Refunded**, **Partially refunded**, or **Disputed**.

    When an order succeeds, Crevio automatically grants the customer access to the experiences attached to the purchased price variants.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The customer journey

Here is how it all connects, from product creation to customer access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a product">
    You create a product with a name, description, and media. This is the listing customers will see.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create experiences">
    You create the experiences you want to deliver -- a course, a set of downloadable files, a Discord server invite, or any combination.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up price variants">
    Add one or more price variants to your product—such as a $29/month subscription and a $249 lifetime access option. Each price variant can be connected to one or more experiences that customers will unlock when they purchase that variant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer checks out">
    A customer visits your storefront or follows a direct checkout link. They select a price variant, enter their payment details through the Stripe-powered checkout, and complete the purchase.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access is granted">
    Crevio automatically creates an order and grants the customer access to the experiences associated with their chosen price variant. They can log in and access their content immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Experience types

Experiences are the building blocks of what you deliver to customers. You can attach multiple experiences to a single price variant to create product bundles.

| Experience | Description |
|---|---|
| **Course** | A structured learning experience with chapters and lessons. Supports video, text, and file attachments. Track student progress and offer completion certificates. |
| **Digital download** | Files your customers can download after purchase. Upload any file type -- PDFs, ZIP archives, templates, presets, and more. |
| **Written content** | Rich-text articles or guides delivered through the Crevio content viewer. Great for tutorials, playbooks, or exclusive written content. |
| **Discord server** | Automatically grant and revoke access to a Discord server or specific roles. Useful for paid communities and support channels. |
| **Telegram group** | Manage paid access to a Telegram group or channel. Members are added on purchase and removed on cancellation or refund. |
| **Event** | Live or scheduled events with session management. Sell access to webinars, workshops, or virtual meetups. |
| **Forum** | A community discussion space hosted on Crevio. Customers can create posts, comment, and interact with each other. |
| **Link** | A simple redirect to an external URL. Use this to grant access to third-party tools, resources, or private pages. |
| **Website embed** | Embed an external website or application within the Crevio content viewer using an iframe. |

<Tip>
  You can mix and match experiences freely. For example, a single product could include a course, a Discord community, and a set of downloadable templates -- all delivered automatically on purchase.
</Tip>

## Your storefront

Every Crevio account comes with a link-in-bio style storefront at `yourname.crevio.site`. This is a customizable page where you can showcase your products, add text and media blocks, display FAQs, and link to your social profiles.

Your storefront acts as the central hub for your digital business. Share the link in your social bios, email signatures, and content to drive customers to your products.

You can also connect a [custom domain](/integrations/custom-domain) to serve your storefront from your own URL.
