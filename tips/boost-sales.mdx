## Use checkout links for direct purchases

Skip the browsing step entirely. Create a [checkout link](/features/checkout#checkout-links) for a specific price variant and share it directly in emails, social posts, or DMs. Customers land straight on the payment page.

<Tip>
  Each checkout link comes with a QR code. Print it on business cards, event banners, or physical products for instant mobile checkout.
</Tip>

## Pre-apply discount codes

When creating a checkout link, attach a [discount](/features/discounts) directly. Customers see the reduced price without entering a code -- reducing friction at the point of sale.

## Create urgency with limited discounts

Set constraints on your discount codes to drive action:

- **Max redemptions** -- limit a code to 50 uses so customers feel urgency
- **Expiration dates** -- set a `redeem_by` date for time-limited promotions
- **Combine both** -- "First 20 customers get 30% off, valid this week only"

## Cross-sell related products

Each price variant can recommend up to 2 related products during checkout. When a customer is already committed to buying, they're more likely to add related items.

  <Step title="Add cross-sells">
    Select up to 2 related products to recommend during checkout.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optimize pay-what-you-want pricing

When using pay-what-you-want, set your **preset amount** slightly above the minimum. Most customers anchor to the preset value.

| Setting | Recommended approach |
|---------|---------------------|
| Minimum amount | Set to your floor price (e.g., $5) |
| Preset amount | Set 20-40% above minimum (e.g., $8) |
| Maximum amount | Leave blank or set high to not limit generous buyers |

## Use waitlists to gauge demand

Enable waitlists on products before launch. This lets you:

- Measure demand before creating content
- Build an email list of interested customers
- Create anticipation for your launch

## Offer free trials on subscriptions

For subscription products, add a free trial period. This lowers the barrier to entry and lets customers experience your content before committing.

<Note>
  Free trials require a connected Stripe account. Customers enter payment details upfront but aren't charged until the trial ends.
