## Courses

Structure your courses for completion:

- **Keep chapters focused** -- each chapter should cover one topic
- **Use progress tracking** -- students can see their completion percentage, which motivates them to finish
- **Add multiple instructors** -- for team-taught courses, assign instructors to provide credibility
- **Order lessons logically** -- arrange content from foundational to advanced

<Tip>
  Monitor lesson completion rates in your analytics. If students drop off at a specific lesson, consider restructuring or breaking it into smaller pieces.
</Tip>

## Digital downloads

- Keep individual files under **2 GB** -- this is the per-item limit
- Use clear file names so customers know what they're downloading
- Group related files into a single download experience for a cleaner delivery

## Discord communities

Choose the right cancellation action for your community:

| Action | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| No action | Lifetime access communities |
| Remove role | Tiered access where you want members to stay but lose premium channels |
| Kick user | Subscription communities where access should fully end |
| Remove all roles | Clean break when a customer has multiple product roles |

<Note>
  Customers must connect their Discord account via OAuth to receive automatic role assignment. Remind them in your onboarding.
</Note>

## Telegram groups

- Use the auto-invite flow so customers don't need to find your group manually
- For multiple tiers, create separate Telegram groups per price variant
- Enable automatic removal on cancellation to keep your group exclusive

## Access types

Use **Secret** (default) for content that each customer should access individually. Use **Open** for team-shared resources where all team members need access.

## Seat-based access

Use seat quantity when selling team licenses or group packages. Each seat generates a separate access token that can be claimed by a different person.

## Time-limited access

Set **revoke after days** on a price variant to automatically remove access after a period. Good for:

- Time-limited courses (e.g., 90-day boot camps)
- Trial access to premium content
- Seasonal or event-based content
