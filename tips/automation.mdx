## Webhook-powered workflows

[Webhooks](/developer/guides/webhooks) let you react to events in real time. When something happens in Crevio, your server gets notified.

### Common automations

| Event | Automation idea |
|-------|-----------------|
| `order.paid` | Send a custom welcome email, add to your CRM, or trigger a Slack notification |
| `customer.created` | Add the customer to your email marketing tool |
| `invoice.past_due` | Send a reminder or flag the account in your system |
| `product.updated` | Sync product data to your external storefront |

<Tip>
  Use a service like Zapier or Make to connect Crevio webhooks to thousands of other apps without writing code.
</Tip>

## API automation

The [Crevio API](/developer/guides/api-overview) lets you programmatically manage your store:

- **Bulk customer creation** -- import customers from another platform
- **Dynamic pricing** -- update price variants based on external factors
- **Order reporting** -- pull order data into your own analytics system
- **Automated discounts** -- create and manage discount codes programmatically

```typescript
import { Crevio } from "@crevio/sdk";

const crevio = new Crevio({
  security: { apiKey: "YOUR_API_TOKEN" },
});

// Create a time-limited discount
await crevio.discounts.create({
  discount: {
    code: "FLASH50",
    discountType: "percent_off",
    percentOff: 50,
    maxRedemptions: 100,
    redeemBy: "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z",
  },
});
```

## Discord and Telegram auto-management

Both integrations run automatically once configured:

### Discord
- **On purchase**: Customer is added to your server and assigned the configured role
- **On cancellation**: The configured action runs (remove role, kick, etc.)
- No manual member management needed

### Telegram
- **On purchase**: Customer receives an invite link via the Crevio bot
- **On cancellation**: Customer is removed or banned based on your settings

<Note>
  Both integrations require the customer to connect their account via OAuth. Prompt them during onboarding or on their order confirmation page.
</Note>

## Scheduled publishing

Use the blog's [scheduled publishing](/features/blog#scheduled-publishing) to maintain a consistent content cadence:

1. Write multiple blog posts in advance
2. Set each one to publish at a specific date and time
3. Crevio automatically publishes them on schedule

This keeps your storefront fresh and helps with SEO without requiring you to be online at publish time.
