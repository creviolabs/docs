## Product SEO

Every product has customizable SEO fields under the SEO section:

| Field | Guideline |
|-------|-----------|
| Title | Keep under 60 characters. Include your primary keyword. |
| Description | Keep under 160 characters. Write a compelling summary. |

<Tip>
  If you leave SEO fields empty, Crevio uses your product name and description as defaults. Custom SEO lets you target specific search terms.
</Tip>

## Blog SEO

Your [blog](/features/blog) is a content marketing engine. Use it strategically:

- **Publish consistently** -- search engines reward fresh content
- **Use categories** -- organized content helps search engines understand your site structure
- **Set indexability** -- toggle indexability off for internal or draft-quality posts that shouldn't appear in search results
- **Add social media images** -- these appear in link previews on social platforms and drive click-through

### Featured images

Each blog post supports two image types:

- **Featured image** -- displayed on your blog listing and at the top of the post
- **Social media image** -- used in Open Graph and Twitter card previews when your post is shared

## Storefront SEO

Your link-in-bio page has its own SEO settings (title and description). This is the page search engines find at `yourname.crevio.site`.

- Set a clear, keyword-rich title that describes what you sell
- Write a description that communicates your value proposition in under 160 characters

## Custom domains

Using a [custom domain](/integrations/custom-domain) instead of the default subdomain improves SEO:

- Builds domain authority under your own brand
- Looks more professional in search results
- Avoids sharing domain reputation with other creators

<Note>
  Custom domains get automatic SSL certificates, so your site is served over HTTPS -- a ranking factor for search engines.
</Note>

## General tips

- Use descriptive product slugs (e.g., `/complete-react-course` not `/product-123`)
- Write unique descriptions for each product -- avoid duplicate content
- Link between your blog posts and product pages to build internal linking
- Share your content on social media to generate backlinks
