Discounts let you offer percentage or fixed-amount reductions on your products. Create codes that your buyers enter at [checkout](/features/checkout), or pre-apply them to [checkout links](#using-discounts-with-checkout-links) for a seamless promotional experience.

## Creating a discount code

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Discounts">
  Open **Discounts** in your dashboard and click **New discount**.
</Step>

<Step title="Set the code">
  Enter a unique code that buyers will type at checkout (e.g., `WELCOME20`, `LAUNCH50`). Codes are unique within your account and case-insensitive at checkout.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose the discount type">
  Select whether the discount is a **percentage off** or a **fixed amount off** the price.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure duration and limits">
  Set how long the discount lasts, how many times it can be redeemed, and when it expires. See the sections below for details on each option.
</Step>

<Step title="Optionally target specific price variants">
  If you want the discount to apply only to certain products or tiers, select the specific price variants it targets.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Discount types

| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Percentage off** | Reduces the price by a percentage (1% -- 100%) | `HALF` gives 50% off |
| **Fixed amount off** | Reduces the price by a flat amount in a specific currency | `SAVE10` takes $10 off |

<Note>
  A discount can be either percentage-based or fixed-amount, not both. Fixed-amount discounts are tied to a specific currency.
</Note>

## Duration

Duration controls how the discount applies over time, which matters most for subscription products.

| Duration | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Once** | The discount applies to the first payment only. For subscriptions, the buyer pays the discounted price on their first billing cycle, then full price afterward. |
| **Repeating** | The discount applies for a set number of months. You specify **duration in months** -- the discount is active for that many billing cycles, then the subscription reverts to full price. |
| **Forever** | The discount applies to every payment for the lifetime of the subscription (or the single payment for one-time products). |

<Tip>
  For one-time products, all three duration options behave the same since there is only one payment. Duration matters most when running promotions on subscription products.
</Tip>

## Max redemptions

Set a **max redemptions** limit to cap how many times a code can be used across all buyers. Once the limit is reached, the code automatically stops working. Leave this blank for unlimited redemptions.

Crevio tracks the number of times each code has been redeemed. You can see the current count on the discount's detail page.

<Warning>
  A discount that has been redeemed at least once cannot be deleted. You can deactivate it instead by changing its status to **Inactive**.
</Warning>

## Expiration dates

Set a **redeem by** date to make a code expire automatically at a specific time. After the expiration date passes, the code can no longer be applied at checkout.

The expiration date must be in the future when you create or update the discount.

## Targeting specific price variants

By default, a discount applies to any product at checkout. To narrow it down, you can target **specific price variants**. When a discount is targeted:

- It only works if the buyer's checkout contains one of the targeted variants
- It has no effect on other products or variants

This is useful when you want to run a promotion on a specific tier (e.g., 20% off the annual plan) without discounting your other offerings.

## Using discounts with checkout links

You can pre-apply a discount to a [checkout link](/features/checkout#checkout-links). When a buyer opens the link, the discount is already applied -- they do not need to enter a code manually.

This is especially effective for:
- **Email campaigns** -- Include a checkout link with the discount baked in
- **Social media promotions** -- Share a single URL that gives followers an instant deal
- **Partner referrals** -- Create unique discount + checkout link combos for each partner

<Note>
  A checkout link can only have one discount applied. The discount must be in an **Active** status when the link is created or updated.
</Note>

## Discount statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | The code is live and can be used at checkout (subject to redemption limits and expiration). |
| **Inactive** | The code is disabled and cannot be used at checkout. Existing subscriptions already using the discount are unaffected. |
