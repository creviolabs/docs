Crevio accounts support multiple users, so you can bring on collaborators, assistants, or business partners without sharing your login credentials. Each team member gets their own login and a role that controls what they can access.

## Roles

Every team member has one of three roles:

| Role | Access level |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access to everything, including billing, account deletion, and team management. Every account has exactly one owner -- the person who created the account. Ownership cannot be transferred. |
| **Admin** | Full access to products, orders, customers, analytics, settings, and team management. Admins can do everything the owner can except manage billing or delete the account. |
| **Member** | Limited access. Members can view and manage day-to-day content but cannot access account settings, billing, or team management. |

<Note>
  The account owner is always treated as an admin and cannot have their admin role removed. This ensures there is always at least one person with full access to the account.
</Note>

## Inviting team members

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Team settings">
  Open **Settings** in your dashboard and navigate to the **Team** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Send an invitation">
  Enter the email address of the person you want to invite and select the role you want to assign them (admin or member).
</Step>

<Step title="They accept the invitation">
  The invitee receives an email with a link to accept the invitation. If they already have a Crevio account, they are added to your team immediately. If not, they create an account first and are then added.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  You cannot invite someone who is already a member of your account. If you need to change their role, update it from the team settings page instead.
</Warning>

## Admin seat limits

The number of admin users you can have depends on your plan. Each plan includes a set number of admin seats:

- **Starter plan** -- Limited admin seats
- **Creator plan** -- More admin seats included

If you have reached your plan's admin seat limit, you will need to upgrade your plan before inviting additional admin users. Member seats are not limited by plan.

## Managing team permissions

From the team settings page, you can:

- **View all team members** -- See everyone on your team, their role, and when they joined
- **Change roles** -- Promote a member to admin or change an admin to a member
- **Remove team members** -- Remove someone from your account entirely
- **Cancel pending invitations** -- Revoke invitations that have not yet been accepted

## Account ownership

The account owner is the person who originally created the account. The owner has a permanent admin role that cannot be removed, and they are the only user who can manage billing and delete the account.

<Tip>
  If you need multiple people with broad access, invite them as admins. Admin users have nearly the same capabilities as the owner, with the exception of billing management and account deletion.
</Tip>

## Multi-account membership

A single Crevio user can belong to multiple accounts. This is useful for freelancers, agencies, or creators who manage several brands. Each account has its own team, products, customers, and settings -- there is no data shared between accounts unless explicitly configured through the API.

When a user belongs to multiple accounts, they can switch between them from their account selector in the dashboard.
