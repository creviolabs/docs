Crevio includes a built-in analytics dashboard that gives you a clear view of how your store is performing. From revenue trends to traffic sources, you can monitor the metrics that matter without leaving your dashboard.

## Analytics dashboard

The analytics page is available under **Analytics** in your dashboard. It shows data for a configurable date range (defaulting to the last 30 days) and compares it against the previous period so you can spot trends at a glance.

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 60 seconds, so the numbers stay current as new orders and visits come in.

## Key metrics

The main chart at the top of the page lets you toggle between four primary metrics:

| Metric | What it tracks |
|--------|---------------|
| **Leads** | New lead customers acquired per day -- people who provided their email through a free checkout or waitlist. |
| **Sessions** | Storefront visits per day. A session represents a single visitor's browsing activity. |
| **Orders** | Orders placed per day across all products. |
| **Revenue** | Total revenue collected per day, displayed in your account's default currency. |

Each metric shows:
- The total for the selected period
- A percentage change compared to the previous period of equal length
- A day-by-day trend line

<Tip>
  Use the date range selector to zoom in on a specific promotion, launch, or time window. The previous-period comparison adjusts automatically.

## Traffic analytics

Below the main chart, you will find detailed breakdowns of your storefront traffic:

### Visits by device

See how your visitors are accessing your store -- desktop, mobile, or tablet. This helps you prioritize design and testing for the devices your audience actually uses.

### Visits by source

Understand where your traffic comes from. Sources include direct visits, search engines, social media platforms, referral links, and any UTM-tagged campaigns you are running.

### Visits by page

See which pages on your storefront get the most views. Use this to identify your best-performing products, landing pages, and content.

### Visits by country

View a geographic breakdown of your visitors. This can help you decide whether to add support for additional currencies, languages, or region-specific promotions.

## Sales by discount code

Track how your [discount codes](/features/discounts) are performing. This chart shows revenue generated through each active discount code, so you can measure the impact of your promotions and decide which codes to keep, extend, or retire.

## Dashboard overview

Your main **Dashboard** page also surfaces key analytics at a glance:

- **Monthly page views** -- Total storefront views in the last 30 days
- **Monthly revenue** -- Total revenue from successful orders in the last 30 days
- **Monthly orders** -- Number of orders placed in the last 30 days
- **Recent orders** -- The five most recent orders with customer details

## PostHog integration

For deeper product analytics, Crevio integrates with [PostHog](https://posthog.com). PostHog provides:

- **Event tracking** -- Detailed tracking of user interactions across your dashboard and storefront
- **User identification** -- Automatic identification of logged-in users for cohort analysis
- **Session recordings** -- Watch how buyers interact with your checkout and product pages
- **Feature flags** -- Roll out new features gradually to subsets of your audience

PostHog runs alongside Crevio's built-in analytics, so you get both a high-level overview in your dashboard and granular event-level data when you need to dig deeper.

## Built-in event tracking with Ahoy

Under the hood, Crevio uses [Ahoy](https://github.com/ankane/ahoy) to track visits and events on your storefront. Ahoy records:

- **Visits** -- Each unique visitor session, including referrer, device type, browser, OS, and geographic location
- **Events** -- Specific actions taken during a visit, scoped to your account

This data powers the analytics dashboard and is stored within your Crevio account. It is not shared with third parties.

<Note>
  Analytics data is scoped to your account. If you manage multiple accounts, each has its own independent analytics.
