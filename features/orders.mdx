An order is created every time a buyer completes [checkout](/features/checkout). Orders track what was purchased, how much was paid, and whether the buyer has been granted access to their purchased experiences.

## Order statuses

Every order has a status that reflects the current state of payment.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Succeeded** | Payment was captured successfully. The buyer has been granted access to their purchased experiences. |
| **Pending** | The order has been created but payment has not yet been confirmed. |
| **Failed** | The payment attempt failed (e.g., insufficient funds, declined card). |
| **Refunded** | The full order amount has been refunded to the buyer. |
| **Partially refunded** | A portion of the order amount has been refunded while the remainder stands. |
| **Disputed** | The buyer has opened a payment dispute (chargeback) with their bank or card issuer. |

<Note>
  Free orders (where every item has a free price variant) skip payment processing entirely and are marked as **Succeeded** immediately.
</Note>

## Order line items

Each order contains one or more line items. A line item represents a specific [price variant](/features/pricing) that the buyer selected during checkout, along with the quantity purchased.

Line items link back to both the product and the price variant, so you can see exactly what tier the buyer chose and what experiences they are entitled to.

## Access tokens

When an order succeeds, Crevio generates an **access token** -- a unique, secure link that the buyer uses to claim their purchased experiences. Access tokens serve several purposes:

- **Content delivery** -- Buyers follow the access link to view or download their purchased content.
- **Seat-based orders** -- For products with seat-based pricing, each seat gets its own access token. The buyer claims one token, and additional tokens can be shared with team members via email invites.
- **View tracking** -- Access tokens track how many times content has been viewed and from which IP addresses, enabling optional authentication gating after a set number of free views.

<Tip>
  Access tokens are included in the order confirmation sent to the buyer. You can also find them in the order detail view in your dashboard.

## Refunds

You can issue refunds for any succeeded order directly from your dashboard or through Stripe.

### Full refunds

A full refund returns the entire order amount to the buyer. The order status changes to **Refunded** and any inventory limits on the purchased price variants are automatically restored.

### Partial refunds

A partial refund returns a portion of the order amount. The order status changes to **Partially refunded**. This is useful when a buyer is unsatisfied with part of a bundle or when you want to offer a goodwill credit without reversing the entire purchase.

<Note>
  When an order is fully refunded or fails, Crevio automatically restores inventory for all line items. This means the refunded units become available for purchase again without manual intervention.

## Viewing and filtering orders

The **Orders** page in your dashboard shows all orders across your account, sorted by most recent. Each row displays:

- Order ID
- Status
- Customer name and email
- Amount and currency
- Date placed
- Whether a discount was applied

You can expand any order to see its full details, including:
- **Line items** -- The products and price variants purchased
- **Customer** -- The buyer's profile and contact information
- **Discount** -- The discount code applied, if any
- **Access tokens** -- The tokens generated for content delivery
- **Charge** -- The Stripe charge details including fees

## Order details page

Click on an order to open its detail page. Here you see the complete picture:

- Full line item breakdown with product names, price variant names, and quantities
- Customer profile with a link to their [customer detail page](/features/customers)
- Payment details including the amount, currency, and Stripe charge reference
- Subscription information (if the order is tied to a recurring subscription)
- Access token status showing whether tokens have been claimed

## Free orders

Orders where all items have free price variants are handled without any payment processing. These orders are marked as **Succeeded** immediately upon checkout completion, and the buyer receives access to the associated experiences just like a paid order. Free orders do not have a Stripe charge attached.
