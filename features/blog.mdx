Your Crevio blog lets you publish articles directly on your storefront. Use it to share updates, tutorials, behind-the-scenes content, or anything that builds trust with your audience and drives them toward your products.

## Creating a blog post

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Blog">
  Open **Blog** in your dashboard and click **New post**.
</Step>

<Step title="Write your post">
  Enter a title (3 to 200 characters) and write your content using the rich text editor. The editor supports formatting, headings, lists, links, images, and more.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a featured image">
  Upload a featured image that appears at the top of the post and in blog listing pages. This is the primary visual for your article.
</Step>

<Step title="Assign a category (optional)">
  Select a category to organize your post. Categories help readers browse related content and keep your blog structured.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish or schedule">
  Choose when to make the post live. You can publish immediately, save as a draft, or schedule it for a future date.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Post statuses

Every blog post has one of four statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | The default status for new posts. Draft posts are not visible on your storefront. Use this while you are still writing or editing. |
| **Published** | The post is live on your storefront and visible to visitors. A published-at timestamp is set automatically when you publish. |
| **Scheduled** | The post will be published automatically at the date and time you specify. Until then, it is not visible on your storefront. |
| **Archived** | The post is hidden from your storefront. Use this to retire a post without deleting it. |

<Note>
  You can move a post between statuses at any time. Scheduling a post requires setting a future date and time -- Crevio automatically publishes it when that moment arrives.
</Note>

## Scheduled publishing

Set a future date and time to have a post go live automatically. When you set a post's status to **Scheduled**:

1. You choose the exact date and time for publication
2. The post remains hidden from your storefront until then
3. At the scheduled time, Crevio automatically transitions the post to **Published**

<Tip>
  Scheduled publishing is great for content calendars. Write a batch of posts in advance and schedule them throughout the week to maintain a consistent publishing cadence.
</Tip>

## Categories

Organize your blog posts with categories. Each category has:

- A **name** (2 to 50 characters, unique per account)
- An optional **description** (up to 500 characters)
- An auto-generated **slug** for its URL

Categories help readers find related posts and give your blog a structured navigation. Each post can belong to one category. Categories with no posts are hidden from blog navigation by default.

## Featured images and social media images

Each blog post supports two types of images:

| Image type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Featured image** | Appears at the top of the post and on blog listing pages. This is the main visual for the article. |
| **Social media image** | Used as the Open Graph image when the post is shared on social platforms (X, Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, etc.). If not set, the featured image is used as a fallback. |

<Tip>
  Upload a dedicated social media image with your post title or key visual baked in. This makes your links stand out in social feeds and messaging apps.
</Tip>

## SEO metadata

Each blog post has optional SEO fields that control how it appears in search engines and social previews:

- **SEO title** -- Up to 60 characters. Displayed as the page title in search results.
- **SEO description** -- Up to 160 characters. Displayed as the snippet beneath the title in search results.

If you leave these blank, Crevio uses the post title and excerpt as defaults.

## Excerpts

Every post has an excerpt -- a short summary shown in blog listing pages and RSS feeds. You can:

- **Write a custom excerpt** -- Enter your own summary text for full control over how the post is previewed
- **Let Crevio auto-generate it** -- If you leave the excerpt blank, Crevio strips the HTML from your content and truncates it to 200 characters as a preview

<Tip>
  Writing a custom excerpt gives you control over the preview text readers see before clicking into the full post. A compelling excerpt can significantly improve click-through rates on your blog index.
</Tip>

## Blog indexability

Control whether search engines can index your blog posts using the **indexable** toggle. By default, all published posts are indexable.

When indexability is turned off for a post:
- Search engines are instructed not to index the page
- The post is still accessible via its URL, but it will not appear in search results

This is useful for:
- Time-sensitive announcements you do not want lingering in search results
- Internal-facing content shared via direct link
- Posts you want to soft-launch before making discoverable
