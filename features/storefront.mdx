Your storefront is your public-facing page on Crevio -- a customizable link-in-bio page where visitors can browse your products, learn about you, and make purchases. Every Crevio account gets a storefront at `yourname.crevio.site`.

## Your link-in-bio page

Your storefront lives at:

```
https://yourname.crevio.site
```

This is the page your audience sees when they visit your Crevio URL. It combines your profile, social links, and a collection of customizable blocks into a single, focused page designed to convert visitors into customers.

<Tip>
  Use your storefront URL as your link-in-bio on social media profiles, email signatures, and anywhere you want to send people to a single page that represents everything you offer.
</Tip>

## Customizable blocks

Build your storefront by adding, removing, and reordering blocks. Each block serves a different purpose, and you can combine them in any order to create the layout you want.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Text">
  Add rich text content to your page. Use it for an introduction, mission statement, testimonials, or any freeform content you want visitors to read.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Image">
  Display an image on your page. Use it for banners, feature graphics, portfolio pieces, or any visual content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Video">
  Embed a video on your page. Great for introductions, product demos, course previews, or behind-the-scenes content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Divider">
  Add visual separation between sections. Use dividers to create clear content groups and improve scannability.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="FAQ">
  Add a list of frequently asked questions with expandable answers. Each FAQ block can contain multiple question-and-answer pairs. Use it to address common objections, explain your offerings, or provide support information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Store">
  Display a grid of your products directly on your storefront. Select which products to feature -- visitors can browse and click through to purchase without navigating away from your page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Link">
  Add a clickable link button to your page. Use it to direct visitors to external resources, social profiles, landing pages, or anything outside your Crevio storefront.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Lead Magnet">
  Capture email addresses in exchange for a free resource. Configure a headline, call-to-action button, and choose a delivery method:

  - **None** -- Collect the email only, no delivery
  - **File** -- Deliver a downloadable file (up to 500 MB) after form submission
  - **Experience** -- Grant access to an [experience](/features/experiences) after form submission

  Lead magnets are one of the most effective ways to build your email list and grow your audience.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Every block can be:
- **Reordered** by dragging it to a new position
- **Hidden** without deleting it (toggle visibility on or off)
- **Given a custom title** for your own organizational reference

## Background customization

Customize the background of your storefront to match your brand:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Flat color** | A single solid color background. Choose any color you like. |
| **Gradient** | A gradient between two colors for a more dynamic look. |
| **Image** | Upload a background image. Adjust the overlay opacity to ensure your content remains readable. |

You can also adjust the overall opacity of the background to fine-tune how it interacts with your content.

## Look and feel

Beyond the background, you can configure several visual settings:

- **Avatar style** -- Choose between a squared or rounded avatar shape
- **Font family** -- Select a font that matches your brand personality
- **Button style** -- Choose a button appearance (default or custom) with configurable background and text colors
- **Card style** -- Pick a card appearance (e.g., soft shadow) with configurable border radius (rounded or sharp)

## Social links

Add links to your social profiles and they appear as icons on your storefront. Crevio supports the following platforms:

- Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram, LinkedIn
- YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest
- Discord, Twitch, Telegram
- Email address
- Custom URL

Each social link is validated for the correct format and normalized automatically -- you can paste a full profile URL or just your username. Social links can be reordered and toggled on or off.

## SEO settings

Your storefront includes SEO fields that control how it appears in search engines and social previews:

- **SEO title** -- Up to 60 characters. Displayed as the page title in search results.
- **SEO description** -- Up to 160 characters. Displayed as the snippet beneath the title.

If you leave these blank, Crevio uses your account name and bio as defaults.

## Custom domains

You can connect a custom domain to your storefront so it is accessible at your own URL (e.g., `shop.yourbrand.com`) instead of the default `yourname.crevio.site` subdomain.

For setup instructions and DNS configuration, see [Custom domains](/integrations/custom-domain).
