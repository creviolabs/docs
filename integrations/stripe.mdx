Crevio uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as its payment processor. All paid transactions -- one-time purchases, subscriptions, and invoices -- flow through your Stripe account. You keep full ownership of your Stripe account and customer relationships.

## Connecting your Stripe account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    In your dashboard, navigate to **Settings** > **Payments**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Stripe onboarding">
    Click **Connect with Stripe**. You will be redirected to Stripe's onboarding flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete onboarding">
    If you already have a Stripe account, sign in and select it. Otherwise, Stripe walks you through creating a new account. You will need to provide your business details, bank account information, and identity verification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Crevio">
    Once onboarding is complete, you are redirected back to Crevio. Your Stripe account is now connected and you can start accepting payments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You only need Stripe for paid products. Free products work without a Stripe connection.
</Note>

## How payments work

Crevio uses Stripe's **custom UI checkout mode** to keep the entire payment experience on your storefront. Buyers never leave your page to complete a purchase.

When a buyer checks out:

1. Crevio creates a Stripe Checkout Session in custom UI mode.
2. Stripe's embedded payment form collects card details, billing info, and tax directly within your storefront.
3. On successful payment, Stripe sends a webhook to Crevio.
4. Crevio creates the order, grants experience access, and sends the buyer a confirmation.

Crevio automatically determines the checkout mode based on the items in the cart:

| Cart contents | Checkout mode |
|---------------|---------------|
| One-time items only | `payment` mode |
| Any subscription item | `subscription` mode |

<Warning>
  You cannot mix subscription and one-time items in a single checkout.
</Warning>

## Subscription management

Stripe handles all recurring billing for subscription products. When a buyer subscribes:

- Stripe charges the buyer automatically on each billing cycle (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual).
- If a payment fails, Stripe retries according to its [smart retry](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries) schedule.
- When a subscription is cancelled or lapses, Crevio automatically revokes the buyer's access to the associated experiences.

You can view and manage active subscriptions from the Stripe dashboard. Crevio stays in sync through Stripe webhooks.

## Refund handling

Refunds are processed through Stripe and reflected in Crevio automatically:

- **Full refunds** -- The order status changes to **Refunded** and the buyer's experience access is revoked.
- **Partial refunds** -- The order status changes to **Partially refunded**. Experience access is preserved unless you manually revoke it.

You can issue refunds from your Stripe dashboard or through Crevio's embedded payment management panel in **Settings** > **Payments**.

<Note>
  If a price variant has limited inventory, refunding an order automatically restores the inventory count.
</Note>

## Payout configuration

Payouts transfer your Stripe balance to your bank account. You can configure your payout schedule from **Settings** > **Payments** in Crevio.

Available payout options:

| Schedule | How it works |
|----------|-------------|
| **Daily** | Automatic daily transfers to your bank account |
| **Weekly** | Transfers on a specific day of the week |
| **Monthly** | Transfers on a specific day of the month |
| **Manual** | You trigger payouts manually when you want |

You can also request an **instant payout** for immediate access to your funds (subject to Stripe's instant payout eligibility and fees).

## Test mode vs live mode

Stripe provides separate test and live environments so you can verify your setup before accepting real payments.

| Mode | When to use | Payment behavior |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Test mode** | During development and setup | Uses Stripe's test card numbers (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242`). No real charges are made. |
| **Live mode** | After you have verified your integration | Processes real payments with real cards. |

<Tip>
  Use test mode to walk through the full checkout flow -- create a product, add a price variant, and complete a purchase with a test card -- before going live. This helps you verify that experience access, email confirmations, and webhooks all work as expected.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I see 'Charges not enabled' when a buyer tries to check out">
    Your Stripe account onboarding may be incomplete. Go to **Settings** > **Payments** and check for any pending requirements. Stripe may need additional identity verification or banking details before you can accept charges.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payments are not showing up in Crevio">
    Crevio relies on Stripe webhooks to process payments. If webhooks are misconfigured or Stripe is experiencing delays, there may be a lag. Check your Stripe dashboard's webhook logs for delivery failures.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I want to switch to a different Stripe account">
    Contact [support@crevio.co](mailto:support@crevio.co) for assistance with reconnecting a different Stripe account. Existing orders and subscriptions are tied to your current Stripe account.
