description: "Serve your Crevio storefront from your own domain for a fully branded experience."
---

Every Crevio account gets a free subdomain at `yourname.crevio.site`. If you want your storefront to live on your own domain (e.g., `shop.yourbrand.com`), you can connect a custom domain in a few minutes.

## Why use a custom domain

- **Branding** -- Your storefront URL matches your brand instead of showing `crevio.site`.
- **SEO** -- Search engines treat your domain as part of your own web presence, building domain authority for your brand rather than Crevio's.
- **Trust** -- Customers are more likely to purchase from a URL they recognize as yours.
- **Consistency** -- If you already have a website, your storefront feels like a natural extension of it.

## Default subdomain

When you create your Crevio account, you choose a subdomain. Your storefront is immediately available at:

```
https://yourname.crevio.site
```

This subdomain is always active, even after you connect a custom domain. Your subdomain must be:

- Between 2 and 42 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Unique across all Crevio accounts

<Note>
  Certain subdomains are reserved (e.g., `admin`, `api`, `app`, `dashboard`, `www`) and cannot be used.
</Note>

## Setting up a custom domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Custom Domain settings">
    In your dashboard, navigate to **Settings** > **Custom Domain**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your domain">
    Type the domain you want to use (e.g., `shop.yourbrand.com` or `yourbrand.com`). Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Add a CNAME record at your domain registrar or DNS provider pointing to Crevio's target hostname. See the [DNS configuration](#dns-configuration) section below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for verification">
    Crevio checks your DNS configuration automatically. Once verified, your domain goes through SSL provisioning and becomes active.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## DNS configuration

Add the following CNAME record to your domain's DNS settings:

| Type | Name | Target |
|------|------|--------|
| `CNAME` | Your domain (e.g., `shop`) | `customers.crevio.site` |

<Tip>
  If you are using a subdomain like `shop.yourbrand.com`, the **Name** field is `shop`. If you are using a root domain like `yourbrand.com`, some DNS providers require you to use `@` as the name or use an ALIAS/ANAME record instead of CNAME.
</Tip>

### Example DNS configurations

**Subdomain (recommended)**

| Type | Name | Target |
|------|------|--------|
| `CNAME` | `shop` | `customers.crevio.site` |

Your storefront will be available at `https://shop.yourbrand.com`.

**Root domain**

Root domains (`yourbrand.com` without a subdomain prefix) cannot use standard CNAME records due to DNS specifications. Check if your DNS provider supports one of these alternatives:

- **ALIAS record** (supported by DNSimple, AWS Route 53, and others)
- **ANAME record** (supported by Cloudflare, DNS Made Easy, and others)
- **CNAME flattening** (supported by Cloudflare)

If your provider does not support any of these, use a subdomain instead.

## Domain verification process

After you add the DNS record, Crevio verifies your domain in stages:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Pending** | Crevio is waiting for your DNS record to propagate. This typically takes a few minutes but can take up to 48 hours depending on your DNS provider. |
| **SSL pending** | DNS has been verified. Crevio is provisioning an SSL certificate for your domain. |
| **Active** | Your domain is verified, SSL is active, and your storefront is live on the custom domain. |
| **Error** | Something went wrong. Check that your DNS record is correct and try again. |

<Note>
  DNS propagation times vary by provider. If your domain stays in **Pending** for more than a few hours, double-check your CNAME record and ensure there are no conflicting records (like an existing A record on the same name).
</Note>

## SSL / HTTPS

SSL certificates are provisioned **automatically** for your custom domain. You do not need to purchase, upload, or manage certificates yourself.

- Crevio uses Cloudflare for SSL provisioning.
- Certificates are issued and renewed automatically.
- All traffic is served over HTTPS. HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
- Your customers always see the padlock icon in their browser.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My domain is stuck in 'Pending'">
    Verify that the CNAME record is correctly set up at your DNS provider. Use a tool like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to confirm that the record has propagated. Remove any conflicting A records on the same hostname.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SSL certificate is not being issued">
    SSL provisioning happens after DNS verification. If your domain is in **SSL pending** for more than an hour, try removing and re-adding the domain in your Crevio settings. Ensure your DNS provider is not proxying the CNAME record (if using Cloudflare for DNS, set the proxy status to **DNS only** / grey cloud).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I want to change my custom domain">
    Go to **Settings** > **Custom Domain**, remove the current domain, and add the new one. Update your DNS records accordingly. The old domain will stop serving your storefront once removed.
