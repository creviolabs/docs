---

The Crevio API lets you programmatically manage your account's products, orders, customers, checkouts, and more. Use it to build custom storefronts, sync data with external systems, or automate workflows.

## What you can do with the API

- **Products** -- Create, update, list, and retrieve products and price variants.
- **Orders** -- List and retrieve order details.
- **Customers** -- List, retrieve, and manage customer records.
- **Checkouts** -- Create checkout sessions and retrieve checkout details.
- **Checkout links** -- Create and manage shareable checkout links.
- **Experiences** -- List and retrieve experiences and their content.
- **Discounts** -- Create and manage discount codes.
- **Blog posts** -- Create and manage blog content.

## Authentication

All API requests are authenticated using **Bearer tokens**. Include your API token in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl https://api.crevio.co/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

Requests without a valid token receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

## Base URL

All API endpoints use the following base URL:

```
https://api.crevio.co/v1
```

## Creating API tokens

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Developer settings">
    In your dashboard, navigate to **Settings** > **Developer**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new token">
    Click **New API token** and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "My integration" or "Storefront sync").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the token">
    Your token is displayed once. Copy it and store it securely. You will not be able to view it again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Treat API tokens like passwords. Do not commit them to version control, share them in public channels, or include them in client-side code. Store them in environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

API tokens are scoped to your account. Any request made with a token acts on behalf of the user who created it, within the context of that account.

### Token management

- Tokens display their **last used** timestamp so you can identify stale tokens.
- You can delete a token at any time to revoke access immediately.
- Each account can have multiple active tokens.

## Rate limiting

The API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and platform stability. If you exceed the rate limit, the API responds with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code. Wait for the period indicated in the response headers before retrying.

<Tip>
  Implement exponential backoff in your API client to handle rate limits gracefully. The `@crevio/sdk` handles this automatically.
</Tip>

## Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results. The response includes an `items` array and a `pagination` object:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "prod_abc123", "name": "My Course" },
    { "id": "prod_def456", "name": "Templates Pack" }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "pages": 5,
    "count": 47,
    "limit": 10,
    "offset": 0,
    "from": 1,
    "to": 10,
    "in": 10,
    "last": 5,
    "next": 2,
    "previous": null
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `page` | Current page number |
| `pages` | Total number of pages |
| `count` | Total number of items across all pages |
| `limit` | Number of items per page |
| `offset` | Number of items skipped |
| `from` | Position of the first item on this page |
| `to` | Position of the last item on this page |
| `in` | Number of items on this page |
| `last` | Last page number |
| `next` | Next page number, or `null` if on the last page |
| `previous` | Previous page number, or `null` if on the first page |

Use the `page` query parameter to navigate between pages:

```bash
curl https://api.crevio.co/v1/products?page=2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Error format

When a request fails, the API returns a JSON error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "validation_error",
    "message": "Name can't be blank",
    "details": {
      "name": ["can't be blank"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type` | The error category (e.g., `validation_error`, `not_found`, `parameter_missing`, `error`) |
| `message` | A human-readable description of what went wrong |
| `details` | Field-level validation errors (included for validation errors only) |

### Common error types

| Type | HTTP status | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `validation_error` | `422` | The request body contains invalid data |
| `not_found` | `404` | The requested resource does not exist |
| `parameter_missing` | `400` | A required parameter is missing |
| `error` | `500` | An unexpected server error occurred |

## Available SDKs

### @crevio/sdk (TypeScript)

The official TypeScript SDK provides a type-safe client for the Crevio API with Zod validation, automatic retries, and support for multiple runtimes (Node.js, browsers, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno).

Install it with your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @crevio/sdk
```

```bash bun
bun add @crevio/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @crevio/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @crevio/sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

Basic usage:

```typescript
import { Crevio } from "@crevio/sdk";

const crevio = new Crevio({
  bearerAuth: "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
});

// List products
const { items, pagination } = await crevio.products.list();

// Get a specific product
const product = await crevio.products.get("prod_abc123");

// Create a checkout
const checkout = await crevio.checkouts.create({
  priceVariantId: "pv_xyz789",
});
```

The SDK handles authentication, pagination, error handling, and retries automatically.
